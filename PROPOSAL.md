# Ethan and India Project Proposal

## Student Clock in / Admin Program to view Clock in Times and Tell who was late.

### Description and Motivation

The program that we are going to create, will start by prompting a student that is stored in a database with all other students.  Once a student types in their credentials the program will then check to see if that name is valid. If the name is valid it will continue on asking the student what time they are clocking in. If the name is invalid user will be prompted with an error telling to give a valid name. This will run for the entirety of the day until every one is ready to be clocked out. The second part of this program will have a separate page for an admin/instructor to check when everyone clocked in and to see who all was on time/late. 

## Prior Art

These types of programs are used every single day in many different places. There are many different iterations and ways to do this. This method of clocking in and out and being able to read who/what time they clocked has been used on paper and pen for a long time. This software is just a way to automate it and make it easier and less tasking for people trying to use it.

## Core User Workflows

- **Student Login : Students names will already be implemented into the software so all they would have to do is provide a valid name for them to clock in under.**
- **Student Clock-In Time and Date** : The student/user will then enter a time that they have arrived at school and once they type in their time it will be saved into a list associated with their name. They will be informed whether they are late or not.
- **Admin Student time check** : Anyone who has access to the admin program will be able to see the exact times that students arrived and will also give a number of how many people are late.

## Daily Goals

**Tuesday : Students should all be associated in a list. Then Students should be recognized when they type in their name.**

Our main goal for Tuesday is to set up the lists of the students and create input validation for student names in the list, when a student enters their name. This will involve creating an input validation loop for checking the name and setting up basic user IO.

**Wednesday : Create more IO that prompts the user for what time they are clocking. And validates that Time.**

The goal for Wednesday is to get the program to recognize times that students clocked in and send them into a list that is stored for the day. Start creating the second file that will allow an admin to see all the students who clocked in and their times.

**Thursday : Dry up any and wet code. Established and fix any and all bugs that are associated with the program and run tests**

The goal for this day is to make sure that all code is in order and easy to understand for someone else going to read it. Also to run tests and debug any bugs that may be present in the code. And if time allows to start creating a [readme](http://readme.md).txt that explains the exact function of the program and shows examples.
